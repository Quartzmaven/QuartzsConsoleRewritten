# What is this, again?
Quartz's Console: Rewritten (formerly known as "Quartz's Console: Redesigned N' Remodernized") is a successor and rewrite to Quartz's Console, if Legacy was never discontinued. Thanks to Wilyicario's Legacy4J mod, it now features a near 100% parity with the Console Edition GUI's. It still aims to balance old and new features to the game. 

Compatible with PC, Linux, and Steam Deck.

Read [my guide](https://qconsoles-organization.gitbook.io/quartzs-console-wiki/installation) on how to set it up!
